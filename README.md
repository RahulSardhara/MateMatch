# MateMatch üíç
MateMatch is a matrimonial matchmaking app built using **Kotlin**, **MVVM**, and **Clean Architecture**. The app integrates both **local storage** and **remote data** using **Room**, **Retrofit**, and **Paging 3**. Users can browse profiles, accept or reject matches, and view filtered lists based on status.

This project uses **Clean Architecture** to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.
## üß™ Why Clean Architecture?

- ‚úÖ Easy testing (UseCases are separated)
- ‚úÖ Modular, readable, and maintainable
- ‚úÖ Enables reuse of business logic
- ‚úÖ Separates logic from UI and data sources



## üß™ Modified & Filtered API Response
Although the app uses the public API [randomuser.me] (https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10), which does not provide all the fields required in a matrimonial app, we‚Äôve **augmented the response** to include three critical

| Field      | Source              | Description                                                                 |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `education`| Generated           | Based on age ‚Äî simulates real-world education levels like B.Tech, MBA       |
| `religion` | Randomly generated  | Selected from a fixed list of religions (Hindu, Muslim, Christian, etc.)    |
| `caste`    | Based on religion   | Generated from a caste list corresponding to the selected religion          |

### ‚úÖ Justification

- **Education**: A critical filtering field in Indian matchmaking platforms.
- **Religion**: Often used to narrow down matches based on personal/family preferences.
- **Caste**: A traditional but widely used criterion in Indian matrimonial culture.

These fields are dynamically generated in the domain model mapping logic:

```kotlin
val religion = generateFakeReligion()
val caste = generateFakeCaste(religion)
val education = generateFakeEducation(age)

##‚ù§Ô∏è Match Score Logic Description

| Factor     | Weight              | Description                                                                                  |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Age`      | 50 pts              | Users closest to a target age (e.g., 28) score higher; each year difference reduces 5 pts    |
| `City`     | 50 pts              | Users from the same city as the current user receive full city score                         |

fun calculateMatchScore(age: Int, city: String): Int {
    val ageScore = (50 - abs(28 - age) * 5).coerceAtLeast(0)  // age proximity
    val cityScore = if (city == "Mumbai") 50 else 0           // city match
    return ageScore + cityScore                               // total out of 100
}

##üì∂ Offline & Error Handling Strategy

| Situation      | Strategy                                     |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `No internet`  | Data fetched from Room DB                    |
| `Errors`       | Handled via ViewModel ‚Üí UI event channels    |
| `No data`      | ViewStub fallback with no_data layout        |
| `API failure`  | Snackbar with error message shown            |


## üß† Reflection: Design Constraints
## ‚úÖ If Images Are Not Legal (Privacy Policy)
Profile image hidden (ivProfile.setGone())

## üß† Reflection: Time Constraints
-** If I had more time, I would have implemented Room database encryption to secure sensitive user data and enhance app security, especially given the nature of a matrimonial app.
-** Improve UI/UX polish, including subtle animations and transitions for a smoother and more engaging user experience.
-** Analytics and crash reporting integration (e.g., Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics) to monitor app performance and user behavior in real-time.
-** Advanced match-making algorithm using machine learning or weighted scoring based on preferences like education, lifestyle, and interests.
-** Dark mode support for better usability and user comfort in low-light environments.


Fallback initials shown via tvAvatar
if (IS_IMAGE_LEGAL_POLICY) { //IS_IMAGE_LEGAL_POLICY this value is set from utils.Constant
    ivProfile.setGone()
    tvAvatar.setVisible()
    tvAvatar.text = initials
} else {
    ivProfile.setVisible()
    tvAvatar.setGone()
}

##‚úÖ If Fully Offline Matchmaking Is Required

- **Switch to Room + PagingSource only
- **Implement search/filter queries on Room DB
- **Use WorkManager for periodic background sync

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Key Features

- **Browse profiles from randomuser.me
- **Paginated UI with accepted/rejected states
- **Match scoring algorithm
- **Profile filtering based on status
- **Local storage using Room
- **Fallback avatar when profile images are disabled
